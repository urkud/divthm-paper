  abstract     = "Lean is a new open source theorem prover being
                  developed at Microsoft Research and Carnegie Mellon
                  University, with a small trusted kernel based on
                  dependent type theory. It aims to bridge the gap
                  between interactive and automated theorem proving,
                  by situating automated tools and methods in a
                  framework that supports user interaction and the
                  construction of fully specified axiomatic
                  proofs. Lean is an ongoing and long-term effort, but
                  it already provides many useful components,
                  integrated development environments, and a rich API
                  which can be used to embed it into other systems. It
                  is currently being used to formalize category
                  theory, homotopy type theory, and abstract
                  algebra. We describe the project goals, system
                  architecture, and main features, and we discuss
                  applications and continuing work.",

                  (PNT), a classic result from number theory
                  characterizing the asymptotic density of the
                  primes. The formalization, conducted using the HOL
                  Light theorem prover, proceeds from the most basic
                  axioms for mathematics yet builds from that
                  foundation to develop the necessary analytic
                  machinery including Cauchy’s integral formula, so
                  that we are able to formalize a direct, modern and
                  elegant proof instead of the more involved
                  ‘elementary’ Erdös-Selberg argument. As well as
                  setting the work in context and describing the
                  highlights of the formalization, we analyze the
                  relationship between the formal proof and its
                  informal counterpart and so attempt to derive some
                  general lessons about the formalization of
